# E-Commerce Backend - John Zigterman

## Description

- With some provided code, I aimed to develop backend functionality allowing the user to access a database of products, categories, and tags.
- This application allows the user to receive a list of all products, categories, or tags, as well as individual items of the same types.
- The user may do this through insomnia or other query systems.
- I implemented this project so it would be easily usable on a local hosting setup.

## Installation

The user can install all of the necessary npm packages by typing 'npm i' in the console.

## Usage

For the backend to be effective, the user must start the server using 'npm start' and then make requests to it using Insomnia or other means, following the requirements for JSON data when applicable, as in put and post requests.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
